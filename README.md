# 👾 Hello Frens! 🧪

I am actively contributing to **Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks** at an early stage by participating in testnets and validator programs.  
My goal is to support decentralized ecosystems by validating, running nodes, and providing valuable insights.

📌 **What I Do**
- 🛠️ Preparing **testnet guides, node installation guides, and update guides** (especially in Turkish).
- 🔗 Engaging in validator collaborations to enhance network stability and security.
- 🚀 Exploring new blockchain projects and contributing to the PoS ecosystem.
